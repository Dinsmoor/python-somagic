TL;DR: ralc is no longer hosted on GitHub. Find it on GitLab!

For some time now, GitHub has been abandoning its culture of sharing based on the principles of openness, meritocracy and equality for all contributors, regardless of race and gender; all aparently due to pressure from political groups.

Hearing about the internal restructuring over at GitHub was the final nail in the coffin that pushed me to accept that GitHub has lost track of the values that made it grow.

So with that, I (@pappad) will stop using GitHub for all my projects and will no longer recommend it for people looking to host theirs.

I will now use GitLab for hosting git repos and my profile can be found on gitlab.

So long GitHub, and thanks for all the git!


# python-somagic
Python utility to allow for multiple camera monitoring for the SoMagic EasyCap

It requires root privilidges due to the somagic-capture utlity requiring root privlidges. It hasn't wrecked anything on my system, but I can't say the same for yours.

It's fairly horrible, wrote it a few years ago and forgot to upload it. I don't use the hardware anymore, so I don't care to update it.

Video is fairly good, it will make a small movie for each camera with ffmpeg every 2 hours of still frames. Do whatever you want with it. I upgraded to a proper video capture card and zoneminder installation.
